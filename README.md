Originally I received a freelance project that I really liked and wanted to do - to improve on a simple booking service that ultilizes Google calendar integration, Stripe payment, etc. In the end however money became an issue and the client backed out much to my disappointment.

I decided to continue on with the project on my own for my own personal experience and enjoyment.
